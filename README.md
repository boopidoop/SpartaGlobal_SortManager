# Engineering 120 â€“ Sort Manager Project
# Brief
You will be assigned to a group of 3-4 for this project. 

You will be building and unit testing a program that will allow a user to sort a random array of integers. The project is 1 spring long. 

The General flow of the application is: 
- The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from (Console)
- Decision is given via the command line Console.ReadLine()
- The program will then ask for the length of an array via the command line

The program should then output:
- The unsorted randomly generated array
- The algorithm to be used
- The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
- Time taken

You should include, but are not limited to:
- BubbleSort
- MergeSort 
- .NET library sort methods

You should use the MVC pattern to separate the IO (View) from the controller and model and the Factory Method pattern to generate the requested model classes.

There will be a review halfway through the project (Thursday 21stJuly,1.30pm), where you will demonstrate your work so far, and additional requirements will be given.

Please create a private repo for your group and invite me (**nishman89**) and Peter (**PBellaby**) to it. Make sure that you commit regularly and merge regularly with meaningful Messages

Create a project board for your project and add 6 columns:
- Backlog of user stories and tasks
- In Progress
- Review
- Done
- Notes
